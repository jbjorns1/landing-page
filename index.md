I’m Soren Bjornstad,
    software developer, computer geek, writer, and musician.

I work at [Federated Insurance][Fed] in Owatonna, Minnesota,
    recommending and implementing development software and tools
    and advising other developers in the I.S. department
        on their work as it relates to these tools.

When I’m not at work or making music by myself or at my church, I enjoy
    fiddling endlessly with my computer setup,
    practicing my typing or handwriting skills,
    cooking, baking, and canning,
    writing prose,
    reading in psychology and philosophy and a wide variety of other topics,
    and collecting and organizing quotations and stories from my life.

I write about technology weekly on [Control-Alt-Backspace][cab].
You can find a large volume of other thoughts
    in various stages of completeness
    in the public portions of [my Zettelkasten][]
    (have a look over there for details on what that is).
