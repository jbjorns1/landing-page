Email
-----

You can send email to <code>contact@sorenbjornstad.com</code>
    ([mailto link](mailto:contact@sorenbjornstad.com)).
I check my personal email once a day;
    if you have an urgent issue, please call or text instead (see below).
If I'm gone for more than a day or two,
    I ordinarily leave an autoresponse message with details about my vacation
    and options for contacting me about time-sensitive matters.

If you use some form of [OpenPGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy),
encrypted mail is accepted;
my public key is [here](http://sorenbjornstad.com/downloads/sorenbjornstad.asc).


Phone
-----

You can call or text me at +1 (219) 649-1767.
Due to the volume of robocalls I receive nowadays,
I will likely not pick up the phone if I don’t recognize your number,
but if you leave a message, I will call you back promptly.


Facebook
--------

If you are Facebook friends with me and prefer Facebook messages to email,
I am okay communicating that way instead;
however, I am much less reliable about checking Facebook.
If you don’t get a response from me within a reasonable amount of time,
please try emailing instead.

If I am not already your friend on Facebook,
please do not try to contact me through Facebook;
it will probably be months before I see your message.
I do not generally accept friend requests from people I have not met in person
or people whose relationship to me is purely professional.

I don’t do other social media.
One site is more than enough for me!


Snail mail
----------

I gladly accept letters, packages, and other (non-junk) mail.
Due to privacy concerns,
if you do not already have my address,
please send me an email or text requesting it
and I will be happy to provide it.
