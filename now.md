* Eight months into COVID-19 semi-lockdown by myself in a 600-square-foot apartment.
  I’m back in the office during the week (with strict COVID protocols),
  but still not able to do much else.
  It’s not all sunshine and roses,
  but it’s gone better than I would have expected,
  so I can be grateful for that.
* Still working at Federated Insurance in Owatonna, Minnesota
  as a software developer and (somewhat self-styled and accidental) DevOps engineer.
* I’m getting ever deeper into the
  wiki/notebook/customizable application environment [TiddlyWiki][tw].
  Along with using it for my own work and personal notes,
  I wrote a plugin called [TiddlyRemember][tr] recently,
  and now I’m drafting a textbook about learning TiddlyWiki,
  hoping to take advantage of the place in my learning
  where I know enough to write it
  but not so much that I’ve lost track of the things that are hard to learn.
* I continue to work on my budding [Zettelkasten][zk],
  as my enforced solitude makes me engage in a lot of thinking, reading, and writing.
* I picked up the mandolin at the beginning of this year
  and am practicing daily –
  timely, since my choirs, my band, and my church music
  are all on hold indefinitely due to COVID-19.
* I am hard at work on a series of posts on my blog [Control-Alt-Backspace][cab]
  about memory and [specifically][] the spaced-repetition tool Anki.
  These are taking a remarkable amount of time,
  but it’s time I shared my expertise in this area more broadly.

*Part of the [now page movement][now].*
