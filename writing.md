I like writing in English as well as in programming languages.
I’ve written well over two million words in my lifetime,
    though much of that is “for internal use only”
    in my various systems for keeping track of my life and developing thoughts.
Some of the places I publish things:

* [Control-Alt-Backspace](https://controlaltbackspace.org),
  a blog that collects ideas on regaining control in an increasingly complex world.
  This is about technology and practical advice for using it,
  but it’s also about
      design,
      human-computer interaction,
      and doing things by hand when it’s more appropriate.
  I post on most Mondays.
* My [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com/).
  A Zettelkasten is a kind of note-taking system
  focused around developing ideas and finding connections between unrelated ideas,
  goals it advances by avoiding chronological or hierarchical orderings
  and making you constantly come back to old notes.
  About two-thirds of my Zettelkasten is published on the web,
  both because it’s really handy to be able to send someone a link
  to details on what I think or know about a particular topic,
  and as a public service because having some publicly accessible Zettelkästen
  with various organizational philosophies and topics
  is extremely useful for new practitioners of the system.
* [The Technical Geekery](https://thetechnicalgeekery.com),
  my old website about computers and technology
  (I’ve been writing about technology since I was in junior high).
   I no longer add new content here,
      but it’s *mostly* not embarrassing
      and still contains a lot of information that may be interesting.
