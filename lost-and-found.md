Rewards
-------

Since 2009, I’ve been keeping various forms of diaries and records of my life.
Maintaining these is very important to me, and since many of them are kept on
paper, losing them is an ever-present concern.

As such, if you find one or more notebooks that have been lost, stolen, or
otherwise unwillingly left my possession, I offer a **$300 cash reward** (plus
reimbursement for anything it costs you to return them) for the safe return of
everything you found, subject to the conditions listed below.

[Contact me][contact] to start the process of returning lost books.

Conditions and Details
----------------------

Since this is a substantial amount of money, I feel compelled to include a bit
of legalese to protect myself against abuses and misunderstandings. If you have
any doubts about whether I will pay the reward under your circumstances, just
[ask][contact] before putting in extra effort and I will let you know.

* The $300 reward is for the return of *all* books that I lost in a given
  incident, not $300 per book. One book and a briefcase full of books are both
  $300. The point is to make returning them worth your time, whatever was lost.
* The book(s) you find must, in aggregate, have at least 10 pages containing
  content (“content” doesn’t include page numbers, empty headings, and so on).
  Empty or nearly empty notebooks are not eligible for rewards – enjoy the free
  notebooks.
* I need to have legitimately lost the books. For instance, if you pick them up
  off a desk in the library when I’m gone but the rest of my stuff is still
  there and there’s no good reason to think I’ve actually lost or left it
  behind yet, I will not offer a reward.
* Similarly, in the unlikely event that I have intentionally thrown the books
  away, no reward or reimbursement of costs will be offered. If you find books
  in a trashcan or similar location, please check with me whether I intended to
  throw them away before spending any money to return them.
* The books need to be in readable, usable condition to receive payment. Minor
  damage is fine if that’s how you found them; a pile of pulp is not. Send me a
  picture or two if you’re unsure if damage qualifies as “minor”.
* The books must reach me in said condition. If you have to ship the books,
  books lost or damaged in transit are your responsibility. Refunded shipping
  costs include tracking and signature service so you can be sure I won’t lie
  about an undelivered or damaged package.
* Shipping costs are covered if you have to travel more than 30 minutes
  round-trip out of your way to return the books to me in person, or if
  traveling to meet me is otherwise impractical for you for some reason. If you
  travel, I will pay mileage or transit fees on request. You must keep itemized
  receipts and a record of distance traveled for any costs you want refunded.
* Shipping, travel, and other costs reimbursed will not exceed $100, even with
  appropriate receipts, unless you have obtained my agreement in writing
  beforehand. Please contact me with an explanation if it appears they will.
* Rewards and costs will be tendered as a personal check, money order, or
  electronic payment when the lost items and copies of your receipts are safely
  in my hands.
* Rewards and costs will be issued in US dollars; any exchange required is your
  responsibility. Costs incurred in other currencies will be exchanged at the
  rate on the day you incurred the cost.
* At my discretion, partial rewards may be offered for returns that don’t meet
  all of the conditions; please contact me to discuss.
* The details of this rewards program may change from time to time. The
  information on this page on the date you find the books supersedes any
  conflicting information found in a notebook that links to this page and
  indicates that this page is the legally binding version of the agreement.
  Changes to this page will be clearly indicated and dated in the “Changes”
  section below.
