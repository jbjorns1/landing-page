Past
---- 

* I did technical support, documentation updates, and occasional development and bug-squishing for the flashcard program [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) with Damien Elmes from 2013 to 2017.
* I spent four years doing first- and second-line support at the IT Helpdesk at my college.
* Occasionally I help people I know with hardware and network setup, configuration problems, learning to use software, and other similar odd jobs.
* I wrote the Clicker Quiz Manager, a custom software package for classroom use; see the projects page linked below for more information.
* I have been a teaching assistant for introductory computer science courses.
